What is a relational database management system (RDBMS)?

A database is a collection of structured data (information) stored in a computer system. In a relational database, all data is tabulated, every row of data is linked with another row using a primary key, and every table is linked with another using a foreign key. Consequently, every piece of information has a relationship with any other piece of information in the database. Most RDBMS use structured query language (SQL) as the standard database language to perform operations on databases. Given the organization of the information, it is relatively easy to scale or traverse through data, compared to other database architectures (e.g. hierarchical databases).


What is SQL?

SQL originated in 1974. Itâ€™s an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard computer language for performing operations on a relational database. SQL commands are used for data definition (CREATE, ALTER, DROP), data manipulation (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), and data control (GRANT, REVOKE). With SQL, users can access, describe, define, and manipulate data in a RDBMS. Furthermore, one can store a procedure or routine or set of functions, and also set permissions on query products (e.g. tables, views, etc.). SQL is simple and easy to understand.
